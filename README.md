# Project_Belfry
 
 Project_Belfry is a project that I have been working on for a long time by now. When I created this everything started to move from being on paper and in my mind to on the computer. I will not show a lot of the data as that is classified (Hence The Military-ish Name). However I will eventually release it once I finally know it's ready. This is still a "Work In Progress" so this among many things will be updated. In the "Datasheets" category there is a file labled "NOT OFFICAL SOURCE", that means that that data sheet is something I made becuase the manufacturer didn't have a data sheet for my model so I made one. Do not use that datasheet because somethings may be wrong... YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! Thank you!
